            <h2 class="h2">Every idea ðŸ’¡ starts with a need</h2>
            <p class="p">Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I could improve my design skills
                and attract more customers. I wanted to start designing some ideas that for a long time I had only on
                paper and stored on my cell phone, I decided to look for some challenge, something that makes more sense
                with what I thought. I saw that many designers (especially in dribbble) made a daily user interface, I
                really liked the idea, but the problem was that the result was just something nice and did not solve any
                problem.</p>

                Only when you experience a problem yourself do you understand the frustration of the users and resolve
                to end it.

                By looking at problems from a different perspective, your ideas will be fresher and more valuable.

            <p><span>Share and show your work</span><br>
                As designers, we are often afraid of showing work thatâ€™s not finished or doesnâ€™t look perfect. You will
                learn to accept feedback and learn from it.

            <p>It has to be a problem thatâ€™s personally affecting or affected you, like finding your keys, calling a

                It's time to look for solutions. What can you do to solve these problems? It's time to think out of the

                How can design help solve your problem? It's time to think about features and functionality, and then
                start designing. Donâ€™t forget to always ask yourself: Would I actually use this?
